# React Mini Project (*****Insta Share*****)

## ***Website***:[https://durgainstashare.ccbp.tech](https://durgainstashare.ccbp.tech/)ðŸ”—


Throughout the development of the <a  href="https://durgainstashare.ccbp.tech/"  >**Insta Share App**</a>, I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I acquired during the React course. This project was a testament to my growth and proficiency in <a  href="https://react.dev/"  target="_blank">**Reactjs**</a> development.

The app successfully fetched data from an internal server using a class component, demonstrating my understanding of <a  href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html"  target="_blank"> **Component lifecycle methods**</a> and data management. The displayed data was presented in an appealing and organized manner, showcasing my ability to create visually engaging user interfaces.

By incorporating <a  href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp"  target="_blank"> **Routing Concepts**</a> , I crafted a seamless user experience, allowing users to effortlessly navigate different sections of the app. The implementation of authentication and authorization added an important layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users could access specific features.

A notable achievement in this project was the creation of a responsive website. By employing responsive design principles and <a  href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp"  target="_blank"> **Media queries**</a> , I ensured that the app looked and functioned flawlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

the <a  href="https://durgainstashare.ccbp.tech/"  target="_blank">**Insta Share App**</a> stands as a remarkable showcase of my React proficiency. This project not only solidified my understanding of <a  href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp"  target="_blank"> **Routing Concepts**</a> but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities. I am proud of the final result and the valuable knowledge I gained throughout its development.

As I continue my journey in web development, I am excited to build upon this experience and explore new possibilities with <a  href="https://react.dev/"  target="_blank">**Reactjs**</a> . The Insta Share App serves as a strong foundation for future projects, and I am eager to apply my skills to create even more innovative and impactful applications.


# Functionalities of Insta-Share

*****I have successfully implemented all the required functionalities in the Insta Share App:*****

**Login Route:**

- Users can enter their username and password.
- If invalid credentials are provided, an error message received from the server will be displayed.
- Upon successful login, the user will be navigated to the Home Route.
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access the Home Route, Profile Route, or User Profile Route, they will be redirected to the Login Route.
- Similarly, an authenticated user attempting to access the Login Route will be redirected to the Home Route.

**Home Route:**

- When an authenticated user opens the Home Route, an HTTP GET request will be made to the User Stories API URL with the jwt_token in the Cookies.
- A loader will be displayed while fetching the data, and once successful, the response will be displayed.
- If the request fails, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
- Users can click the Retry button to make another HTTP GET request.
- An HTTP GET request will also be made to the Posts API URL with the jwt_token in the Cookies to fetch post data.
- Initially, each post will display icons for liking, commenting, and sharing.
- Clicking on a username within a post will navigate to the User Details Route.
- Users can like and unlike posts, which will trigger HTTP POST requests to the Post Like API URL and update the like status and like count accordingly.

- Clicking on the Profile link will navigate to the My Profile Route.
- Clicking the Logout button will navigate to the Login Route.

**User Profile Route:**

- When an authenticated user opens the User Profile Route, an HTTP GET request will be made to the User Profile API URL with the jwt_token in the Cookies and user_id as a path parameter.

- If the request fails, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
- Users can click the Retry button to make another HTTP GET request.
- The list of posts section will include the BsGrid3X3 icon.
- If the user has no posts, a "No Posts" view will be displayed.
- Clicking on a username within a post will navigate to the User Details Route.
- All functionalities present in the Header will work accordingly.

**My Profile Route:**

- When an authenticated user opens the My Profile Route, an HTTP GET request will be made to the My Profile API URL with the jwt_token in the Cookies.
- A loader will be displayed while fetching the data, and once successful, the response will be displayed.
- If the request fails, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
- Users can click the Retry button to make another HTTP GET request.
- The list of posts section will include the BsGrid3X3 icon.

**Search Functionality:**

- An authenticated user can search posts by clicking on the Search icon and providing a search term.
- An HTTP GET request will be made to the Search Posts API URL with the jwt_token in the Cookies and the search post as a query parameter.
- A loader will be displayed while fetching the data, and once successful, the response will be displayed.
- If the request fails, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
- If the search posts are empty, a "Search Not Found" message will be displayed.
- Initially, each post will display icons for liking, commenting, and sharing.
- Clicking on a username within a post will navigate to the User Details Route.
